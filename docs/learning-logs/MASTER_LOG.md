## Introduction

This project demonstrates four core concepts in modern AI agent development:

1. **Agentic Loops**: How agents think, act, and observe in cycles
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: How to ground LLM responses in your own data
3. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: How to give agents access to tools
4. **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**: How multiple agents coordinate to solve complex tasks

Each phase builds on the previous one. By the end, you'll have a working multi-agent system that can research topics, save notes, and answer questions from your personal knowledge base.
